            <p class="solid"> Also named as the capital of Arab culture, Damascus is the oldest city in the world that has seen many
                of the great civilizations rise and fall. According to research studies and historical evidence, Damascus
                was first inhabited in the second half of the seventh millennia B.C. It is the oldest continuously inhabited
                cities in the world, and is a prominent cultural centre of the Arab world. Today Damascus is a metropolitan
                area with more than two million population and was named the Arab Capital of Culture in 2008.

            <p class="solid">Aleppo serves as the capital of the Aleppo Governorate, and it has been continuously inhabited for more than
                8,000 years. It is a fact that the remnants dating back to 11,000 B.C of human settlements have been found
                there. Aleppo is actually located between the Mediterranean Sea and Mesopotamia, and due to its geographical
                location, it became an important trading hub during the ancient era. However, due to warfare between the
                government and rebel forces that have killed thousands and forced many to flee from their homes, Aleppo has
                been facing devastation since 2012.

            <p class="solid">Located around 42 kilometre north of Beirut, Byblos is the oldest and the largest city in the Mount Lebanon
                Governorate of Lebanon. It is believed to have been first occupied by humans between 8800 and 7000 BC and
                continuously inhabited since 5000 BC. Also, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, it is believed that the first
                import of papyrus in Greece took place in this city. This city is also an archaeological wonder because of
                the successive layers of debris resulting from centuries of human habitation.

            <p class="solid">Athens is the capital and largest city of Greece. It dominates the Attica region with its earliest human
                presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennium BC. This city is also an ancient home of
                philosophy and the birthplace of Western civilisations. In fact it boasts of habitation that goes back long
                before the days of Socrates, Plato and Aristotle. The city withstood the test of times and was a subject of
                complete destruction following the Dorian and Persian invasions. Today, Athens is a sprawling metropolis and
                the oldest capital city in Europe.
